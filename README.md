## Vanilla RAG Implementation Using DSPy

### Overview
This repository contains a Vanilla Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model implementation using the DSPy library. The RAG model combines information retrieval with a generative model to answer questions based on a corpus of documents. The model first retrieves relevant passages from a knowledge base and then generates answers conditioned on these passages.

This project is aimed at providing a basic understanding of how a RAG model works and how it can be implemented using the DSPy library.
