    "## Vanilla RAG using DsPy\n",
    "\n",
    "This code demonstrates the creation of a Vanilla RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model using the DSPy library in Python. Given the limited time frame of a couple of days, the implementation is functional but leaves room for optimization and experimentation across several areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Document Loading: Beyond the PyPDFLoader from LangChain, other libraries like PyPDF2, PDFMiner, Tabula, PDFQuery, or LlamaParse could be explored for potentially better performance or compatibility with different document types.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chunking Strategy: LangChain offers various text splitters, and adjusting parameters like chunk size, overlap, and separators could enhance the efficiency of the model's retrieval process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Embeddings: Different embeddings can be experimented with, balancing memory usage, processing time, and accuracy to better suit the specific use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vector Database: Exploring alternatives such as Faiss, ChromaDB, or others might yield improvements in retrieval speed and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- LLM Model: Experimentation with different language models, such as Llama, GPT, Claude, or Gemini, could lead to better generation quality\n",
    "\n",
    "- Retrieval Strategy: Adjusting the number of relevant chunks retrieved or modifying the retrieval algorithm could optimize the relevance and coherence of generated answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Training and Testing Dataset: Expanding the dataset with more diverse samples can significantly enhance the model's robustness and generalizability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Optimization Techniques: Implementing custom optimization functions tailored to the specific requirements of the task could further refine the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluation Metrics: Developing custom evaluation metrics aligned with the project’s goals would provide more meaningful insights into model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pipeline Configuration: The sequence and combination of modules in the pipeline can be adjusted for better synergy between retrieval and generation stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code forms a solid foundation but with further refinement and testing, the RAG model can be significantly optimized for better results."
